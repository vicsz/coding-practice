# Simple Coding Practice

## Test #1 - String to Integer 

Without using toString method, write a function that given a String returns the corresponding int value.

## Test #2 - Odd occurrences in an array

Given an integer array, return a value that has an odd number of occurrences. 

## Test #3 - Fizz Buzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Test #4 - Set Class 

Implement a set with push(), pop() and length(). 

Not Sets are unordered.  

### Test #5 - Reverse a Sentence 

For example : "bob likes dogs" becomes "dogs likes bob"

### Test #6 - Fibonacci 

Calculate the Fibonacci number for a given int -- i.e. the sum of the previous 2 Fibonacci Numbers. 

f(0) -> 0
f(1) -> 1
f(2) -> 1
f(3) -> 2
f(4) -> 3
f(5) -> 5
f(6) -> 8

### Test #7 - Factors

Given an Integer return all the factors for it. 

f(1) -> 1
f(2) -> 1,2
f(15) -> 1,5,15

### Test #8 - Palindrome

Write a function the checks if a given string is a palindrome. 

i.e. a String whose reverse is equal to the original. 

### Test #9 - Sort an Array

Return a sorted int array. Don't use Java sort methods. 

### Test #10 - Reverse a String

Write a method that returns a reversed String without sing a reverse method.
